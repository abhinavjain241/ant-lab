==============

Find the solution of the following Boundary Value Problems.

### Lab 1

(*Use Shooting Method*)

**Question 1:**  

**yy’’ + 1 + (y’)<sup>2</sup> = 0**

Subject to the boundary conditions y(0) = 1, y(1) = 2	  
Where **h = 0.2**

Take a<sub>0</sub> = 0.5 and a<sub>1</sub> = 1.0



**Question 2:**  

**y’’ - y = 0**

Subject to the boundary conditions y(0) = 0, y(1) = -1	  
Where **h = 0.1**

Take a<sub>0</sub> = 0.3 and a<sub>1</sub> = 0.4

### Lab 2

**Question 1:**  

**y’’ = x + y**

Subject to the boundary conditions y(0) = 0, y(1) = 0	  
Where **h = 0.05**


**Question 2:**  

**y’’ + 2xy + 2y = 4x**

Subject to the boundary conditions y(0) = 1, y(0.5) = 1.279	  
Where **h = 0.025**
