Question 1
----------
**Solve by Quasi-Linearization**

f''' + ff' + 1 - (f')^2 = 0

f(0) = 0, f'(0) = 0, f'(10) = 1

Question 2
----------
**Solve del(u)/del(t) = del^2(u)/del(x^2)**,
0 < x < 1, t >= 0

Initial Condition: u(x, 0) = sin(PI * x)
Boundary Condition: u(0, t) = u(1, t) = 0

Use del(x) = 0.01, for different del(t), solve by implicit scheme
